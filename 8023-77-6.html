  <p><strong><u>4. First Aid Measures</u></strong></p>
  <p><strong>Always seek medical advice after the first aid treatment.</strong></p>
  <p><u>Inhalation:</u> Remove to fresh air. If not breathing, give 
artificial respiration. If  breathing is difficult, give oxygen. Call a 
physician immediately.<br>
    <u>Ingestion:</u> DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. Give large quantities of 
water. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Call a 
physician immediately.<br>
    <u>Skin Contact:</u> In case of contact, wipe off excess material 
from skin then immediately flush skin with plenty of water for at least
 15 minutes. Remove contaminated clothing and shoes. Wash clothing 
before reuse. Call a physician immediately.<br>
    <u>Eye Contact:</u> Immediately flush eyes with gentle but large 
stream of water for at least 15 minutes, lifting lower and upper 
eyelids occasionally. Call a physician immediately.</p>
  <p><strong><u>5. Fire Fighting Measures</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Extinguishing Media Recommended</u>: CO2, foam, dry chemicals, <span>water spray</span>.<br>
    <u>Extinguishing Media Non-Recommended</u>: Direct solid water jet.<br>
    <u>Extinguishing Procedures</u>: Closed containers may build up 
pressure at elevated temperatures. If possible, containers should be 
cooled with a water spray.<br>
    <u>Special Information:</u>&nbsp;In the event of a fire, wear full 
protective clothing and <span>NIOSH</span>-approved self-contained breathing 
apparatus with full face piece operated in the pressure demand or other
 positive pressure mode. At high temperatures under fire conditions, it
 may produce toxic or irritating fumes. Fire-extinguishing work is done
 from the windward and the suitable fire-extinguishing method according
 to the surrounding situation is used. Uninvolved persons should 
evacuate to a safe place. Keep away from ignition sources and <span>naked flame.</span></p>
  <p><strong><u>6. Accidental Release Measures</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Personal  precautions, protective equipment, and emergency procedures</u>:
 Avoid breathing dust/fumes/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Use individual 
protective equipment (waterproof boots, suitable protective clothing, 
safety glasses, etc.). Restrict unprotected personnel from the area. 
Prevent any contact with <span>hot surfaces</span>. Do not approach facing the wind.
 Do not touch the spilled material.<br>
    <u>Environmental precautions</u>: Do not let the product enter drains, soil, or water sources.<br>
    <u>Methods and materials used for containment / Cleanup procedures and Storage</u>:
  Do not inhale dust, vapors, mist, or gas. <span>Avoid dust formation</span>. 
Contain spilled material. Cover with an inert, non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite). Use a shovel to put the material into a convenient waste 
disposal container. Finish cleaning by spreading water on the 
contaminated surface and allow to evacuate as per law.<br>
    <u>Fire Protection</u>: Keep away from ignition sources and <span>naked flame</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><u>7. Handling and Storage</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Precautions for safe handling</u>: Apply according to good 
manufacturing and industrial hygiene practices. Ensure proper 
ventilation. In case of insufficient ventilation, wear suitable 
respiratory equipment. Wash thoroughly after handling. Do not drink, 
eat, or smoke while handling. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and 
clothing. Minimize <span>dust generation</span>. Avoid breathing  
dust/fumes/gas/mist/vapors/spray. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, and 
clothing. Keep container tightly closed. Avoid ingestion and 
inhalation. Use individual protective equipment (waterproof boots, 
suitable protective clothing, safety glasses, etc.). Prevent any 
contact with hot surfaces.<br>
    <u>Conditions for safe storage, including any incompatibilities</u>:
 Store in cool, dry, and ventilated area away from heat sources and 
protected from sunlight in tightly closed original container. Keep air 
contact to a minimum. Store protected from heat, sparks and ignition 
sources and incompatible materials. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. 
Avoid inhalation of dust/mist/vapor. Do not store with incompatible 
materials like strong oxidizing agents, <span>strong acids</span>, or <span>alkalis</span>.<br>
    <u>Fire Protection</u>: Keep away from ignition sources and <span>naked flame</span>.</p>
  <p><strong><u>8. Exposure Controls/Personal Protection</u></strong></p>
  <p><u>Airborne Exposure Limits</u>: There are no occupational exposure limits
established by the region specific regulatory bodies.<br>
    <u>Ventilation System:</u> A system of local and/or general exhaust 
is recommended to keep employee exposures below the Airborne Exposure 
Limits. Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred because it can
 control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing 
dispersion of it into the general work area.<br>
    <u>Personal Respirators (<span>NIOSH</span> Approved):</u> If the exposure limit 
is exceeded and engineering controls are not feasible, a full face 
piece particulate respirator may be worn for 
up to 50 times the exposure limit or the maximum use concentration 
specified by the appropriate regulatory agency or respirator supplier, 
whichever is lowest. If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, <span>cutting fluids</span>,
 glycerin, etc.) are present, use a type R or P filter. For 
emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a
 full-face piece positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator. <br>
 WARNING: Air-purifying respirators do not protect workers in <span>oxygen-deficient</span> 
atmospheres.<br>
    <u>Skin Protection:</u> Wear impervious protective clothing, 
including boots,  gloves, lab coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, 
to prevent skin contact.<br>
    <u>Eye Protection:</u> Use chemical safety goggles and/or full face shield where dusting or splashing of solutions is possible. <span>Maintain eye wash fountain and quick-drench facilities in work area.</span> <br>
    <u>Other Control Measures</u>: Maintain good housekeeping in work 
area. Dust deposits on floors and other surfaces may pick up moisture 
and cause the surfaces to become <span> slippery and present safety hazards</span>. 
Handle in accordance  with good industrial hygiene and safety practice. 
Wash hands after handling.</p>
