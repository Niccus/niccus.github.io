            Prediction 1: Incinerations, Main Season
        </h2>
        <div class="sectionContent">
            <p class="sectionQuestion">
                How many players will be incinerated from active play, from the 24 teams, during the main 90 days of the season?
                This will only count incinerations in specific. New and innovative ways to die will not be counted, and I will assume that incinerations are lethal.<br>
                <br>
                In Season 2β, 16 players from 20 teams were incinerated over 99 days.<br>
                In Season 3β, 26 players from 20 teams were incinerated over 99 days.<br>

            <p>I would argue that this is unimodal around one-team's-worth-of-incinerating, but with the odd spike at 24.</p>
            <p>There are interesting gaps at some odd numbers, but I think it's the small sample size. Not sure what's up with 13.</p>

                How many players will be incinerated over season 2 (NEW), outside of the main season? <br>

            </div>
            <p>A much tighter set of predictions. After all, there aren't many opportunities for death outside the main season.</p>
            <p>That said, some are predicting... maybe one or two whole teams being incinerated? Who knows. Maybe each team gets some fun in the elections.</p>

            <p>By <em>far</em> the most popular theory is that Zephyr will feedback onto the winning team, so the most popular guess is that Zephyr won't kill anyone.</p>

            <p>Nine people were collided into the shadows this past season (well OK, one was in the postseason), and... surprisingly, that's also the average of the predictions for next season? And yet, <em>nobody</em> picked exactly nine.</p>
            <p>I'll claim that most people think there won't be that many additional shadowings, and that the bigger factor is weathers other than Horizon finally appearing.</p>
